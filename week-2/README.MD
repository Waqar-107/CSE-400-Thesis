1. making a class or subclass "disjoint" -> so that only an instance can inherit a single class, avoiding multiple inheritence

2. object property -> set domain and range. object properties describes relationship between two individuals

3. data properties -> describes relationship between instances, individuals or data values. set domain and range. range is the value

4. how to comment : Active Ontology Tab -> hit Annotations -> writ comment

5. if a property b is inverse to property a, then range(b) = domain(a) and range(a) = domain(b). note that the domain-range will be determined autometically if the reasoner is ON and also in the reasoner config. -> object properies inference -> range and domain are checked
